  msp430_deep_sleep: practically turned off MCU with the lowest possible consumption
  msp430_spi_fram: riotee implementation to use MSP as a flash storage
  msp430_testable: switches on all shared gpio one by one (verification after assembly)
  nrf52_demo_rf: A simple demo that sends BLE packets when energy budget allows it
  nrf52_testable: watches all gpio and reports with UART messages (verification after assembly)
  nrf52_rf_test: sends out 1 BLE-Packet per second (verify with an app like 'LightBlue')
  nrf52_deep_sleep: practically turned off MCU with the lowest possible consumption
  nrf52_rf_survey: Link Matrix Generator - TX-Unit - sends packet with every possible P_TX, loops until stopped
